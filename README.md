# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to take the customers datafiles, as they pertain to thier sales, clean and transform them, and determine if there are are insights to be gained to increase revenue or improve processes. We will try to answer some basic questions about where the majority of the revenue comes from as well as what can be done to improve the sales process. 

## Process
The process for this project will be as follows:
-The data will need to be uploaded into the ecommerce database. We will attempt to create this database with as little errors as possible.
-The data will then need to be processed and transformed into usable materials. Here we will make assumptions as to what is relavent to our needs as well as what is accurate. 
-Next we will answer a few basic questions that relate to the purchase of products in regards to diffrent cities and countries.
-We will then attempt to draw a few insights on future business development.
-Lastly we will follow a QA process to ensure accuracy of data.

### Cleaning The Data

We will need to do a great deal of data cleaning to determine what data is usable. We will need to make some assumptions on what is considered accurate data and what can be removed. All of the steps that were taken to clean the data is saved in cleaning_data.md.

### Analytical Insights

We will attempt to gather answers to the following questions:
-Question 1: Which cities and countries have the highest level of transaction revenues on the site?
-Question 2: What is the average number of products ordered from visitors in each city and country?
-Question 3: Is there any pattern in the types (product categories) of products ordered from visitors in each city and country?
-Question 4: What is the top-selling product from each city/country? Can we find any pattern worthy of noting in the products sold?
-Question 5: Can we summarize the impact of revenue generated from each city/country?

Once these basic questions are answered, we will attempt to gain further insight on the sale process by answering the following:
-Question 1: What ProductSKUs are currently unused?
-Question 2: What products are currently stocked that are not being ordered?
-Question 3: Where is most of the traffic on the website coming from?
-Question 4: In preperation for the holiday season, what products are typically sold in november or december?

## Results
The full results of the above analytical insights can be found in thier respective files (starting_with_data.md and starting_with_questions.md) and the summary of these results can be found in the Presentation.pptx file.

## Challenges 
The biggest challenge to this assignment was the cleaning of the raw data. To ensure accurate outputs, we needed to remove a great deal of irrelavent data as well as duplicates. This could potentially have led to removing the wrong data getting inaccurate results. That is where the bulk of the work ended up being. 

## Future Goals
If we had more time for this project more data cleaning would have been done which in turn would have yielded a more robust QA process. With the amount of errors in the database, the final "clean" data could have been even better transformed, but due to time constraints and the lack of input from the data user, we were forced to make assumptions to yield results.
